               The Family Pack TFP:0.3.0.1.0
               =============================

Welcome to the first pre-alpha release of The Family Pack, an ambitious
multi-platform genealogy program with a new evidence based database.

For more details and links to a compiled version for Windows (XT, Visa, 7 and
8) please visit the website at http://thefamilypack.org

The source code has also been compiled on gnu/linux Ubuntu (Unity and Mint)
and Mac OSX (Snow Leopard). See the file build/build.txt for a description of
the build proccess. I am still working on producing binaries for these
platforms.
