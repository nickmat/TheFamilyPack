Build Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The build process has been tested on Windows and MS Visual C++.

1) Download and install wxWidgets version 2.9.3 or later

2) Ensure the environment variable WXWIN is set to wxWidgets root folder.

3) Download and install Bakefile version 0.2.9 or later

4) Run the batch file built-XXX.bat from the build folder, where XXX matches
    the version of MS Visual C++ you are running.

5) Open the folder created by the batch file and open the tfp.sln file in
    MS Visual C++.

If you are using MS Visual C++ 2008 and wxWidgets 2.9.x then you can skip
items (3) and (4) and use the files provided in build\vc9-wx29

TFP creates some source files using the custom utility program file2cpp. The
source for this program is provided in the utils/file2cpp folder. Since the
generated files are supplied ready made, the utility is only needed if the
input files are changed.

Unfortunately, bakefile can't put the file dependencies into the Visual C++
project files, so if you want to change the input files you have the
following options:

    If the changes are minor, make the changes by hand, remembering to change
    both source and generated files.

    Create the file2cpp program and use either nmake on the commandline or
    the files provided in build\vc9-wx29.

    Create the file2cpp program and required project file. Modify the
    tfp.vcproj file by inserting the text found in the
    tfp_tfp-vcproj-processed-files.txt file. Examine the provided
    build\vc9-wx29\tfp.vcproj file to see where it should go.

A similar problem exists for the method of adding the SVN version number to
the TFP version number. This has not yet been added to the bkl files so have
to be added by hand. In MS Visual C++ goto tfp properties/Configuration
Properties/Build Events/Pre-Build Event and enter "../getsvnver.bat" in the
Command Line entry for both Debug and Release configurations. In the
C/C++/Preprocessor Preprocessor Definitions entry add TFP_WORKING to the list.

If anyone successfully builds the project with other compilers or OS's then
please drop me a line to let me know how you got on.
