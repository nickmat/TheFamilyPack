Build Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tfp build system is based on the bakefile program used by the wxWidgets
library.

The build is slightly complicated because of the use of a custom utility 
"file2cpp" which is used to imbed text files into the program. (It was also
used for image files, but these are now in xpm format.) As both the input and
output files of the file2cpp program are supplied, the utility is only 
required if you need to edit the input files. If you have the file2cpp program
installed on your system, you may use the *-dep build folders, otherwise use
the folder without the -dep suffix. 

The build process has been tested on Windows with MS Visual C++ 2008 express
with both the IDE and nmake.

The Gnu/Linux build has been tested on Linux Mint 14 and Ubuntu 11.10

Windows Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Download and install wxWidgets version 2.9.4.
   Ensure the environment variable WXWIN is set to wxWidgets root folder.

2) To compile the test program, download and install the CppUnit framework.
   Set the environment variable CPPUNIT to the library folder.

3) To start the IDE, open the tfp\build\vc9 (or vc9-dep) folder and 
   double click the tfp.sln file. 
   
   To compile from the commandline, open the Visual Studio 2008 (or equivalent)
   Command Prompt and navigate to the tfp\build\nmake (or nmake-dep) folder
   and, for the debug build, enter:-
       nmake -f tfp.mak
   or, for the release build:-
       nmake -f tfp.mak -D WX_DEBUG=0

Add Subversion Version Number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the version number of the last subversion commit is not included as
part of the tfp version number as displayed in the program. This can be added
when using the MS Visual Studio IDE as follows:-

    Open the tfp project properties dialog and make the following changes.
      Configuration Properties
        C/C++
          Preprocessor
            Preprocessor Definitions:
              Add TFP_WORKING to list
              for both Debug and Release Configurations
        Build Events
          Pre-Build Event
            Command Line:
              Add "..\getsvnver.bat"
            Description:
              Add "Update with svn version number"
              for both Debug and Release Configurations

Note that there are some drawbacks to the above changes if you are making
commits to subversion. After commiting you may need to recompile a couple of
times so the new version number is picked up. If anyone knows a better system
that achieves the same end, please let me know. 

Gnu/Linux Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Install build tools
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libwebkitgtk-dev

2) Download the wxWidgets source file with Unix line endings and unpack it.
   From within a terminal, navigate to wxWidgets root directory:-
    mkdir gtk-build
    cd gtk-build
    ../configure --disable-shared
    make
    make install

3) Also from within a terminal, navigate to the tfp/build/gnu directory.
    make
    ./tfp
   should run The family Pack program.
   
Note, the gnu build only includes the libraries and main program - not the
test program or utilities. Anyone with development experience on unix systems
should have no difficulty building these if required.

Mac/OSX Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Download the wxWidgets library (to a folder which we will named wx) and The
   Family Pack code (to a folder which we will name tfp) together in the same
   folder.
   
2) In the terminal, navigate to the wx folder:-
    mkdir build-osx
    cd build-osx
    ../configure --with-osx-cocoa --disable-shared --prefix="$(pwd)"
    make

3) Also in the terminal, navigate to the tfp/build/gnu folder:-
    make WX_CONFIG=../../../wx/build-osx/wx-config
    
4) Create a application bundle with the resulting tfp binary file.
   (I am still investigating the best way of going about this)

Note the the developer is completely new to the mac system and this is his
first attempt at creating a mac app.

Other Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If anyone successfully builds the project with other compilers or OS's then
please drop me a line to let me know how you got on.
