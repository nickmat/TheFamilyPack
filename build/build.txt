Build Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The build process has only been tested on Windows and MS Visual C++ so far.

1) Download and install wxWidgets version 2.9.1 or later

2) Ensure the environment variable WXWIN is set to wxWidgets root folder.

3) Download and install Bakefile version 0.2.8 or later

4) Run the batch file built-XXX.bat from the build folder, where XXX matches
    the version of MS Visual C++ you are running.

5) Open the folder created by the batch file and open the tfp.sln file in 
    MS Visual C++.

If you are using MS Visual C++ 2008 and wxWidgets 2.9.x then you can skip
items (3) and (4) and use the files provided in build\vc9-wx29

If anyone successfully builds the project with other compilers or OS's then
please drop me a line to let me know how you got on.
