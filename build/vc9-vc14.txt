The legacy version of the bakefile program is used to create the build files
used by this project. Bakefile builds vc9 (Visual Studio 2008) project
files, these being the latest version possible using legacy bakefile. In
order to use the vc14 compiler (Visual Studio 2015) we must use Visual
Studios own conversion process.

The conversion works well, but when compiling the libraries a warning
(MSB8012) is produced in connection with the library names. These warnings
can be avoided by making the following changes.

For each library project context menu select 'Properties' and
on the 'Configuration Properties' - 'General' page,
line 'Target Name' change 

'$(ProjectName)' to '$(ProjectName)ud' for the Debug Configuration and

'$(ProjectName)' to '$(ProjectName)u' for the Release Configuration.

This is required for the following libraries:-
  calendar
  rec
  reccl
  recgui
  wxsqlite3

This will have to be repeated each time these library projects are changed.
