Running the cdm.exe program.

NOTE: This describes to initial process to create the common database.
It is expected to evolve as the database and system grows.

The program expects the following files to be in the current working directory:-

tables.csv   List a common data tables and the next common data id (negative) number.
input.tfpd   Contains input records to be transferred to common data pool.

All positive numbers in the input database are to be converted
to negative common numbers. These are then written to csv files.
The csv files will use the table name as a filename (with .csv extension).
If the file already exists, the new records are appended to the file,
otherwise a new file is created.

Finally the tables.csv file is rewritten with updated 'next id numbers'.
