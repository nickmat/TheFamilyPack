            TFP Release Check List
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note, the version numbers used in the svn-trunk refer to the proposed future release number. The definitive version reference will include the svn version number in brackets (without a + suffix). This means the version numbers are incremented immediately after the release.

-) Tag the svn rep.

-) Check pack/win/tfp.nsi for version number, copyright date and sample files.
