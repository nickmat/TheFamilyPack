This Calendar Library (cal) has been designed for use with "The Family Pack" 
application but it is designed to be quite independent. So, for instance, a
Julian Day Number (JDN) of zero has a special meaning within TFP (date not 
known or required), but cal treats it as just another day at the office 
(1 Jan 4713 BCE).

The library is based around julian days, the system used by astronomers to 
mark time since midday Monday 1st January 4713 B.C.E. (Julian Calendar). The 
fractional of the day day is used to denote the time of day, so the day 
commencing Midnight on Tuesday 2nd January 4713 B.C.E. would given as JD 0.5
and Sunday 19th September 1948 C.E. (Gregorian Calendar) is JD 2432313.5.

Because TFP does not normally record the time of day, the fractional part of 
the day is ignored and the day number for the day starting at midday is used
for the whole day. To emphasize the different convention, they are labelled as
Julian Day Numbers (JDN). So the day Sunday 19th September 1948 C.E. (Gregorian 
Calendar) is recorded as JDN 2432314.

The cal library interface consists of a few C++ functions. These are detailed
in the header file calendar.h and normally these are sufficient. They mainly 
convert strings to and from JDN values. The functions use an enumeration of
Calendar Schemes to indicate the scheme being converted. The definition of
a scheme is much broader than is normally associated with calendars. The 
Gregorian Calendar was first introduced in 1582 but the change over was carried
out over several centuries in different countries. Also, the date of the new 
year could vary from place to place. All these different variations have been 
given Calender Scheme names, such as "English Calendar" where the change over
from Julian to Gregorian occurred in Sep 1752 where the 2nd was follows by the 
14th, and between the 12th century and the change over date, new year was on the
25th March. The Scottish Scheme is similar the English but the new year was
always on 1st January.

The Calendar sub-system currently copes with the following types

CALENDAR_SCH_Unstated          No attempt at classifying the calendar system
                               has been made.
CALENDAR_SCH_Unknown           The precise calendar system used is
                               undetermined.
CALENDAR_SCH_Unlisted          The calendar system is known but not currently
                               supported.

    The above system types may be used in TFP. In all cases a text description
    of the date can be recorded and will be displayed where possible. However,
    no calculations can be carried out on these dates and they cannot be
    sorted.


CALENDAR_SCH_JulianDay         The calendar system used internally by TFP.

    Julian Day                 JD = JDN - 0.5

    The Julian Day starting at midday. JDN 0 represents the day starting at
    midday 24 Nov -4713 Gregorian (a Monday). Although the calendar library can correctly
    handle JDN 0 and negative JD Numbers, TFP has a special meaning for jdn 0.
    So for all practical purposes, JD 1 is the earliest date available.


CALENDAR_SCH_ModJulianDay

    Modified Julian Day:        MJD = JDN - 2400001

    A shortened version of the Julian Day, included for completeness.


CALENDAR_SCH_Julian

    Julian Calendar            1 Jan 1 = JDN 1721424

    The main dating system used in the western world from the Roman times until
    it was replaced by the Gregorian Calendar from 1582. Dates around the
    change over where often labelled "Old Style" or OS.

CALENDAR_SCH_Gregorian         1 Jan 1 = JDN 1721426

    Gregorian Calendar


CALENDAR_SCH_Catholic,

    Catholic Calendar

    4 Oct 1582 (Julian) followed by 15 Oct 1582 (Gregorian)

    JDN 2299171 ->  4 Oct 1582 (Old Style)
    JDN 2299172 -> 15 Oct 1582 (New Style)

    The Catholic Calendar uses the Julian Calender up to 4 Oct 1582 (Julian),
    and the Gregorian Calendar there after. Meaning that Thur 4 Oct 1582
    (Catholic) is followed by Fri 15 Oct 1582 (Catholic) and October for that
    year held only 21 days.

CALENDAR_SCH_English,

    New year falls on March 25th between 1100(?) and 1752
    JDN 2361221 ->  2 Sep 1752 (Old Style)
    JDN 2361222 -> 14 Sep 1752 (New Style)
    Scheme also used by British Overseas Territories

CALENDAR_SCH_Scottish,

    New year always 1 Jan (otherwise same as English)
    JDN 2361221 ->  2 Sep 1752 (Old Style)
    JDN 2361222 -> 14 Sep 1752 (New Style)

Imprecise or uncertain dates are held as a date range. In fact all dates in TFP
are held as a date range, but where the date is known it is a range of one day.
This range of possible dates should not be confused with a fixed date range
where, for example, an event is held over a period of time. In this case both
the start and the end dates may themselves be uncertain.


Examples of date ranges (in latin format)

Mon year                               1 Mon year - lastday Mon year
