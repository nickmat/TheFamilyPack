    recUnit: Unit Test Program For The rec Library
    ==============================================

Run the test program with the current directory set to TFP_ROOT/test.
The batch files runRecUnitD.bat and runRecUnitR.bat files can be used,
or run the programs directly.

The program runs tests on a newly created database "test.tfpd" in the
current directory. If there is already a database there, it is deleted
and a new one created. The tests are all designed to be neutral and leave
the database in the same state as it started in.

To test the transfer functions, the program copies the "recunit-1-org.tfpd"
database to "recunit-1.tfpd" (replacing any previous copy) to use.
