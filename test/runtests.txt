    recUnit: Unit Test Program For The rec Library
    ==============================================

Run the test program with the current directory set to TFP_ROOT/test.
The batch files runRecUnitD.bat and runRecUnitR.bat files can be used,
or run the programs directly.

The program runs tests on a newly created database "test.tfpd" in the
current directory. If there is already a database there, it is deleted
and a new one created. The tests are all designed to be neutral and leave
the database in the same state as it started in.

To test the transfer functions, the program copies the "test1-orig.tfpd"
database to "test1.tfpd" (replacing any previous copy) to use.

Creating the "test1-orig.tfpd"
==============================

SQL database files are not very source control (git) friendly, as they
are effectively binary files. Small changes to the contained data can make
large differences to the binary footprint. We side-step this problem
by holding the data in csv format files and create the database as
required. This is the job of the "tdb" (Test DataBase) program.

The tdb program extracts data from an existing database into a set of
csv files and then puts these files into a new database to be used for
testing. The program is controlled with an initialization file - text
files with the .tdb extension. Neither the original, nor the the extracted
database is included in the git repository. (The original is actually a
modified copy of the author family database.) The csv files are included
and the Windows batch file "run-csv1-test1D.bat" can be used to create
the test database file.

The "run-nick-csv1-test1D.bat" and "nick-csv1-test1.tdb" require the
original "Matthews.tfpd" which is not being made available. These files
are included as examples only.
