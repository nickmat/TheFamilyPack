   Revision History
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
 2oct10  v0.3.1
   Modification to strings to enable wxWidgets v2.9.0 compile.
   
 6oct09  v0.3.0
   Program renamed file2cpp to avoid confusion with the GNU program file2c.
   Complete rewrite as a C++ wxWidgets console program. The Format (input) 
   file now uses the @ prefix to control the formatting files being
   transcribed, as shown below.
   
       @{filename}
         Output the filename as a literal C char array.
     
       @(options.commenttype)prefix"filename"postfix[;,whitespace]
         Output the filename as a sequence of C strings with the optional
         prefix and postfix characters and optionally removing whitespace and
         comments. See fcSpec.txt for details.
     
 9apr08  N0.20  (Version not released.)
   Add switch -X, which puts wxWidgets macros, wxT("string"), around text.

10dec05  D0.10  (Version not released.)
   Initial version of File2c, a MS Windows command line program written in C. 
   The program takes an input file and outputs that file with C /* ... */
   comments and blank lines removed. The sequences { filename.ext } and 
   " filename.ext " are replaced with literal representations of the named 
   files. The code sequence { filename.exe } is replaced by a literal C type
   char array. The sequence " filename.ext " is replaced by a list of C type
   strings representing the text lines in a form that will automatically be 
   concatenated. C type comments and blank lines in the text file are removed.
   
   Example:-
   File: test.f2c
____________________________________________________
/* A test of { test.txt } and " test.txt " files */

unsigned char test_txt[] = { test.txt };

size_t sizeof_test_txt = sizeof(test_txt);

const char* test = " test.txt ";
____________________________________________________

    File: test.txt
____________________________________________________
/* test.txt - A file2c test file */
 Hello


"world"!
____________________________________________________

    Command line >File2c test.f2c
    produces the file: test.c
____________________________________________________
/* G:\X\TFP03\UTILS\FILE2CPP\test.c - File created by File2c D0.10 */

unsigned char test_txt[] =  { /* test.txt */

};
size_t sizeof_test_txt = sizeof(test_txt);
const char* test =  /* test.txt */
 " Hello\n"
 "\"world\"!\n"
 "\n";
