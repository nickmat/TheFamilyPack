<blockquote>
 <p>
  SIR WATKINS WILLIAMS WYNNE was talking to a friend about the antiquity of his family, which he carried up to Noah, and was told that he was a mere mushroom of yesterday. "How so, pray?" said the baronet "Why," continued the other, "when I was in Wales, a pedigree of a particular family was shown to me: it filled five large skins of parchment, and near the middle of it was a note in the margin: About this time the world was created."

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The Family Pack is a new genealogy program to store, organize and display family trees. Since it is still being written it is a bit premature to describe how to use it - so for the time being this section is limited to an aspiration list.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-platform MS Windows, Mac OS X and Linux</li>
<li>Evidence based database design</li>
<li>Data entry using templates</li>
<li>Work with separate database systems for Sources, Places and Historic timelines</li>
<li>Able to compare and transfer data directly between databases</li>
<li>GEDCOM file import and export</li>
<li>A built-in script language (initially Tcl, others later) for input and reports</li>
<li>Windows version (at least) to run directly from a CD</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The current development is concentrating on designing the database and producing a Windows alpha version of
  the program.
