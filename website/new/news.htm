<h2>27th July 2014</h2>
<p>
 The Calendar sub-system of The Family Pack is now a separate library and has
 been greatly expanded. It will be used to create a new program, HistoryCal.
 The new project has been moved to its own website at
 <a href='http://historycal.org'>http://historycal.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
 It is hoped that an alpha version of HistoryCal will be released soon. After
 that, the new library will be integrated back into The Family Pack.
</p>
<p>
 If you were wondering why there has been little activity on this project,
 this is why. Once the design and first implementation of HistoryCal is
 completed, I will be able to devote more time to the next release of TFP.

<h2>28th March 2013</h2>
<p>I am pleased to announce the first release of The Family Pack.</p>

<p>This is a very early (pre-alpha) version that is being released to
enable those interested in the project to follow its progress.</p>

<p>The release consists of the following:-</p>
<ul>
<li><b>tfp_0-3-0-1-0-setup.exe</b> - a working Windows version.</li>

<li><b>tfp_0-3-0-1-0-src.zip</b> - Source files with DOS/Win line endings.</li>

<li><b>tfp_0-3-0-1-0-src.gz</b> - Source files with Unix line endings.</li>
</ul>
<p>All files include an example database and gedcoms for testing.
</p>
<p>
The source files include a GNU makefile that has been successfully used
on gnu/linux Ubuntu (Unity and Mint) and on Mac OSX (Snow Leopard).
Details of the build process is also included. I don't have a lot of
experience on these platforms so if there is anyone out there who could
assist in creating distributable binaries for them, it would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy,<br />Nick Matthews<br />Developer for "The Family Pack".
