<h2>24th January 2022</h2>
<p>
    Version <b>TFP 0.3.0.1.1 R3</b> has just been released
    on Github and Sourceforge.
</p>
<p>
    The previous version was a bit buggy when opening
    or creating databases under various conditions.
    This version should fix most of these.
    It also correctly opens a new window on the current database.

<h2>14th January 2022</h2>
<p>
    Version <b>TFP 0.3.0.1.1 R2</b> has just been released
    on Github and Sourceforge.
</p>
<p>
    I have been working towards creating Reference record templates
    which are designed to make it easy to create the evidence side
    of the database.
    Part of this is creating a hierarchical Reference scheme which is now done.
    The source Citation scheme has also been activated,
    although some addition work may be required.
</p>
<p>
    A significant step towards creating a <b>Common Data Database</b>
    has been made.
    The actual database has not been included in this release,
    but it will be required for the Reference templates. 
</p>
<p>
    The next step is to move data records between databases,
    and this is what I will be working on for the next release.
</p>

<h2>12th August 2021</h2>
<p>
    Although the last version (v0.3.0.1.0) was released some years ago,
    work on the program has continued, it's just never been in a state
    suitable for use.
    The database has changed out of all recognition and the program has many additions.
    I have been using it for my own family tree,
    but it is not really suitable for general use.
    However, if anyone is interested in the program and wants to follow its progress,
    I will be releasing some interim versions. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Version v0.3.0.1.1.R1</b> is the first interim release.
    Along with these releases, I will be writing the program's <a href='../dev/man/index.htm'>manual</a>
    located in the development section of the website.
</p>
<p>
    The many changes are documented in the changes.txt file included with the the release.
    They are also documented in the github TheFamilyPack repository log.
</p>

<h2>27th July 2014</h2>
<p>
 The Calendar sub-system of The Family Pack is now a separate library and has
 been greatly expanded. It will be used to create a new program, HistoryCal.
 The new project has been moved to its own website at
 <a href='http://historycal.org'>http://historycal.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
 It is hoped that an alpha version of HistoryCal will be released soon. After
 that, the new library will be integrated back into The Family Pack.
</p>
<p>
 If you were wondering why there has been little activity on this project,
 this is why. Once the design and first implementation of HistoryCal is
 completed, I will be able to devote more time to the next release of TFP.
</p>

<h2>28th March 2013</h2>
<p>I am pleased to announce the first release of The Family Pack.</p>

<p>This is a very early (pre-alpha) version that is being released to
enable those interested in the project to follow its progress.</p>

<p>The release consists of the following:-</p>
<ul>
<li><b>tfp_0-3-0-1-0-setup.exe</b> - a working Windows version.</li>

<li><b>tfp_0-3-0-1-0-src.zip</b> - Source files with DOS/Win line endings.</li>

<li><b>tfp_0-3-0-1-0-src.gz</b> - Source files with Unix line endings.</li>
</ul>
<p>All files include an example database and gedcoms for testing.
</p>
<p>
The source files include a GNU makefile that has been successfully used
on gnu/linux Ubuntu (Unity and Mint) and on Mac OSX (Snow Leopard).
Details of the build process is also included. I don't have a lot of
experience on these platforms so if there is anyone out there who could
assist in creating distributable binaries for them, it would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy,<br />Nick Matthews<br />Developer for "The Family Pack".
